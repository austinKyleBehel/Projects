# Behavioral_analysis.ipynb 
contains the analyses for two psychophysics experiments done through the NIH.

# There are two .ipynb files
(occlusion_speed & occlusion_temporal_estimation)
These are the experiments themselves, using primarily psychoPy with prompts for EyeLink1000 (for eye movement recordings)
These correspond with the analyses file referenced above
